### Sam Moran
Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## Structure
All .html files contain a navbar at the top which can be used to navigate directly to any of the other .html files in this project.

### index.html
This file contains a welcome message, an image, and an @media query which notifies the user that this site is best experienced on desktop if the screen size is small.

### about.html
This file contains some information about me and things that I like.

### resume.html
This file WOULD contain a summary of my resume, if I ever got around to updating that and converting it to a format easily displayable with HTML/CSS.

### work.html
This file contains links and short blurbs about projects I've completed in the past.
